                            <p>It is recommended that institutions have policies and procedures on how they will collect, verify and maintain CACFP enrollment documentation. A CACFP enrollment policy should include the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When the institution will collect enrollment documentation</li>
                                <li>Who is responsible for verifying enrollment documentation</li>
                                <li>Where the enrollment documentation will be kept</li>
                                <li>How the institution will retain the records for the required 3 years plus the current year</li>
                                <li>How the institution will ensure that enrollment records are kept confidential</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Consider organizing enrollment documentation alphabetically in a binder at the center.</p>
                            <p>Although the child participant’s date of birth is not required per the regulations, it is helpful information to collect.</p>
                            <p>In order to show that the documentation is updated annually, it is important to make sure the parent’s or guardian’s signature is dated.</p>
                            <p>Staff should know where enrollment documentation is stored and should follow confidentiality policies to keep it secure.</p>
                            <p>When a child withdraws, write that child’s withdrawal date on the enrollment documentation and then re-file the documentation.</p>
                            <p>Before starting your monthly claim, ensure that all enrollment documentation is up to date and complete.</p>
                            <p>Consider having an annual enrollment date when all enrollment documentation is updated by parents or guardians.</p>
                            <p>The enrollment documentation should be verified for accuracy by a center representative.</p>
                            <p>We recommend that you have a second party person review the enrollment documentation to ensure accuracy.</p>
